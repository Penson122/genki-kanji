# genki-kanji
[Genki 3rd Edition](https://genki3.japantimes.co.jp/en/) for import into [Kanji Study](https://mindtwisted.com/)

The kanji is only taken from the Vocabulary sections in each lesson. Each numbered file corresponds to a lesson in the Genki 3rd Edition book. Any vocabulary that is composed of entirely hiragana or katakana is not listed, translations are also not included. This repo is for usage in studying only the kanji, mostly for writing practice using the Kanji Study App.
